Current status is there are way too many packages most of which have half-written code. You can ignore these. For now, we are simple concerned with making sure seabee is stable and navigates appropriately (i.e. it goes straight when we tell it straight). As such, the only packages you should really be concerned with are seabee_imu_driver and base_controller. 

base_controller - If you want to test motors individually, you can go to the base.py file, and look (it shouldn't be hard to find) for the part where all six motors are given their values. Set the values however you want based on what you're doing. If stability and/or velocity is an issue, try the pid.py file. This collects all of the desired velocity data (currently only coming from the imu and the xbox controller) as well as applying a pid for stability. If the buoyancy of the robot is really off, or there is oscillating behavior, try this file (and probably start with just adjusting the PID values, which should be easy to find). Be careful with the pid values, they're pretty strong - i.e. 1 or 2 should be plenty. A value of 10 is way too much (probably).
